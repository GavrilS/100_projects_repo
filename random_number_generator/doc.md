# Console application to generate random numbers until the user wants them.

* Process:
 - show the user a manual of how to use the console application when the program runs initially
 - ask the user for input on the range and number of random numbers needed
 - give the user a chance to exit (might merge this with the above step)
 - dissect the user input and extract the relevant values or inform the user for wrong input and give instructions again
